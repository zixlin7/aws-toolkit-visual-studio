* Added support for cloning Amazon CodeCatalyst source repositories from Visual Studio's 'Clone a Repository' dialog

v1.37.0.0 (2022-11-07)
* The AWS Toolkit now produces log files for each running instance of Visual Studio. This allows concurrent running instances of Visual Studio to have their own unique Toolkit log file. Previously, the first running instance of Visual Studio would append its logs to the same log file. Log files are now produced in `%localappdata%/AWSToolkit/logs/visualstudio/(VisualStudioVersion)`, and are named based on the date and time when Visual Studio was opened.
* Beanstalk platform versions can now be configured when deploying to existing Beanstalk targets with Publish to AWS.
* Push commands have been updated to use `get-login-password` when viewing an ECR Repository

* Update credentials dialog help to link to the User Guide
* Fixed bug so that default location, if set in Options, is used when creating or cloning CodeCommit repos rather than always defaulting to %USERPROFILE%\Source\Repos.
* The "Publish to AWS" experience is now capable of publishing applications to existing Windows Beanstalk environments

* A bug has been fixed in Publish to AWS when publishing a project to an existing Fargate target, where the Fargate target was previously published using a pre-GA version of Publish to AWS. If the target was configured with multiple security groups, trying to select it would log an 'Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: s.' error. Now, you can re-publish your project to this target, but you need to reconfigure the security groups setting. The setting will display a validation message in the 'Edit Settings' view if reconfiguration is needed. (Fixed in Deploy Tool v1.1.15)
* Fix issue preventing Publish to AWS from publishing to a Fargate target when working with a region that does not have a default VPC. Previously, this would log an `Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: s. Path '', line 0, position 0` error (Fixed in Deploy Tool v1.2.4)

If your account is based in a different partition (like GovCloud or China), you will need to set the `region` field in your credentials profile so that the Toolkit is able to work with the proper set of regions. Previously, this was adjusted using the 'Account Type' field in the add/edit Profile dialog.
* A change was made to the way the Toolkit records which account is used by the AWS Explorer. The first time you launch the Toolkit after updating, the AWS Explorer will not automatically select the account you used previously.
