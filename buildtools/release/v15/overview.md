[The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/welcome.html) improves development workflows by making AWS services available directly from your Visual Studio environment. 

For a current list of integrated AWS services, see the [Working with AWS Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/working-with-services.html) section of the official AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio user guide. 

The following is a selection of the most popular AWS Toolkit services and how they can improve your development experience while working from Visual Studio:

* Navigate the AWS Toolkit, access AWS Services, monitor storage, and manage your resources from the [AWS Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/working-with-services.html).

* Author, deploy, and configure serverless .NET Core C# functions and serverless applications with [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-visual-studio/latest/user-guide/lambda-index.html).
