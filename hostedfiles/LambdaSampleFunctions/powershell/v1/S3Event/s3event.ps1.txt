# PowerShell script file to be executed as a AWS Lambda function.
#
# When executing in Lambda the following variables will be predefined.
#   $LambdaInput - A PSObject that contains the Lambda function input data.
#   $LambdaContext - An Amazon.Lambda.Core.ILambdaContext object that contains information about the currently running Lambda environment.
#
# The last item in the PowerShell pipeline will be returned as the result of the Lambda function.
#
# To include PowerShell modules with your Lambda function, like the AWSPowerShell.NetCore module, add a "#Requires" statement
# indicating the module and version.

#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='AWSPowerShell.NetCore';ModuleVersion='3.3.335.0'}

# Uncomment to send the input event to CloudWatch Logs
# Write-Host (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $LambdaInput -Compress -Depth 5)

    $key = $record.s3.object.key

    Write-Host "Processing event for: bucket = $bucket, key = $key"

    # TODO: Add logic to handle S3 event record, for example
    $obj = Get-S3Object -Bucket $bucket -Key $key
    Write-Host "Object $key is $($obj.Size) bytes"
