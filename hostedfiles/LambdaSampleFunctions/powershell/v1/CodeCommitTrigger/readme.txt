This sample creates a Lambda function written in PowerShell that can be subscribed
as a Code Commit trigger.

The script has a Requires statement for the latest version of the AWS Tools for
PowerShell module. If you modify this example and it does not need cmdlets from that
module you can safely delete this statement.
